DasherizingBuilder
==================

Uses dashes instead of underscores when building XML.
 - useful if you want to use ActiveRecord's to_xml as well.
 - useful when you have a library which uses the dasherized convention to parse your XML.

This is a plugin because Rails won't load it in production as a library...
and since I use it in multiple projects now, it's much easier!

Original source code is by Adam Pearson!

I just made it a plugin.

Enjoy :)


Example
=======

Just use a view file using .xml.api instead of .builder
